Big revamp - sad, but exciting!

Instead of setting up particles via growth, like we do now, set up _noise_
Each cell is one particle
The interaction neighborhood drops to a Moore neighborhood of radius 1
At each time step, if the selected cell is a solid, perform the usual reaction routine
If it's a _liquid_, SWAP it with a neighboring cell!

No more regrinding, volume scaling, etc.
